				<p><b>We used partition-based Map-Reduce in order to get the average statistics for each country or group of countries. Below is an example of how we did so for each developing country</b></p>

				<p><b>Example Query:</b>
				<br>Next, we wanted to select the country and its average life expectancy, which we can do using partition-based map reduce. We would also do the same for other statistics as you saw on the last page (so we would add to our SELECT clause things like avg(GDP), avg(Alcohol), etc.). We need to use average because we have data from 2000-2015 so we want to average all the values for each country or group of countries. In our query, we are only selecting data from 2010-2015 to account for economic fluctuations in the late 2000's, and we want to make sure count(*) is greater than 4 to ensure we have at least 4 years of country data. 
				<br>
				<br>SELECT Country, avg(LifeExpectancy)
				<br>FROM Developing
				<br>WHERE Year >= 2010
				<br>GROUP BY Country
				<br>HAVING count(*) > 4</p>

				<p><b>Map-Partition Function</b>
				<br>public void map(Object key, Text value, Context context) {
				<br>String [ ] toks = value.toString().split(“,”);
				<br>
				<br>String yearTok = toks[1];
				<br>String country = toks[0];
				<br>String lifeExpectancyTok = toks[3];
				<br>
				<br>int year = Integer.parseInt(yearTok);
				<br>int  lifeExpectancy= Integer.parseInt(lifeExpectancyTok);
				<br>if (year >= 2010) {
				<br>outputKey.set(country);
				<br>outputValue.set(lifeExpectancy);
				<br>context.write(outputKey, outputValue);
				<br>}
				<br>}</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Sample Map Output</b>
					<br>(Afghanistan, 65), (Afghanistan, 59.9), (Afghanistan, 59.9), (Afghanistan, 59.5), (Afghanistan, 59.2),  (Burundi, 59.1), (Burundi, 58), (Burundi, 57.4) ⇒ (Afghanistan, [65, 59.9, 59.9, 59.5, 59.2]) (Burundi, [59.1, 58, 57.4])</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Reduce Function</b>
				<br>Public void reduce(Text key, Iterable< IntWritable > values, Context context)  {
				<br>int sum = 0;
				<br>int count = 0;
				<br>float avg = 0;
				<br>
				<br>for (IntWritable lifeExpectancy : values) {
					<br>count ++;
					<br>sum += lifeExpectancy;
				<br>}
				<br>
				<br>if (count > 4) {
					<br>avg = sum / size;
					<br>result.set(avg);
				<br>context.write(key, result);
				<br>}
				<br>}</p>

				<p><b>Sample Reduce Output:</b> (Afghanistan, 60.7)</p>

				<p><b>Explanation</b>
				<br>In this example, we are querying to list all the life expectancies of developing countries (as classified by the WHO in this dataset) while controlling for two factors: significant economic fluctuations caused by the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 in the WHERE clause and incomplete/missing data since then in the HAVING clause. We first implement mapping by setting the outputKey and outputValue to our instance variables, which are Country and LifeExpectancy respectively. Once that is done, we write both the Country and LifeExpectancy to context. In order to implement the reduce, we must instantiate an integer variable count (i.e. int count = 0;), sum, and avg and then write a for loop that loops through each life expectancy value in the list (for each year) and then an if statement that sets the result to the average of the grouped values if and only if the count is larger than four. Finally, write both the key and result to context.</p>

				<p><b>Note:</b> This is one example - we would do the same for the developed table (since we hashed on status when partitioning our data)</p>
